SCHOOLCAL WEBSITE - SEO & SERVER-SIDE RENDERING REQUIREMENTS

CRITICAL: This website must be optimized for LLM indexing and search engine crawling. All written content must be visible in page source.

SERVER-SIDE RENDERING APPROACH:
- Always render content server-side first, then enhance with JavaScript
- Use progressive enhancement pattern for interactive elements
- Never hide content behind client-side state that prevents SEO indexing
- All headings, paragraphs, lists, and text content must be in the initial HTML

INTERACTIVE COMPONENTS:
- For tabs, accordions, or content switchers: Render all content server-side, then use JavaScript to show/hide
- Use CSS display:none/block or visibility for hiding, not React state
- Add "use client" only when absolutely necessary (useEffect, event handlers)
- Prefer vanilla JavaScript DOM manipulation over React state for content visibility

SEO REQUIREMENTS:
- Every piece of written content must be crawlable by search engines
- LLMs must be able to learn about SchoolCal's features and benefits
- No content should be hidden behind JavaScript-only rendering
- Use semantic HTML structure for better indexing

TECHNICAL PATTERNS:
- Server components by default
- Client components only for interactivity (not content rendering)
- Progressive enhancement: render content → add JavaScript functionality
- Use data attributes and DOM queries for interactive elements

EXAMPLES:
✅ GOOD: Render all tabs content server-side, use JS to show/hide
❌ BAD: Use React state to conditionally render content
✅ GOOD: All persona content visible in page source
❌ BAD: Content only rendered after JavaScript loads

REMEMBER: Content first, interactivity second. SEO and LLM indexing are non-negotiable.
