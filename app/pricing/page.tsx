                How is SchoolCal different from my SIS iCal feed?
              </h3>
              <p className="body-large text-text-dark-blue">
                Your SIS probably lets you download an iCal feed. The problem is, each staff member or student needs to download their own feed and upload it to their calendarâ€¦ every time their schedule changes. Besides being a ton of manual work, iCal feeds also aren't publicly visible to the rest of your organization. Which means the individual student or staff member will see that they're busy, but nobody else will. So your staff can't see real-time availability or know when to book them.

              <h3 className="heading-3 text-text-black mb-4">
                How long does SchoolCal take to set up?
              </h3>
              <p className="body-large text-text-dark-blue">
                Very quickly. Most schools are onboarded and set up in about 20 minutes.

            <div>
              <h3 className="heading-3 text-text-black mb-4">
                How long does it take to sync my school's events the first time?
              </h3>
              <p className="body-large text-text-dark-blue">
                Usually 2-3 hours, depending on the amount of event data you need to sync. Event syncs are limited to small batches by Google and Outlook, but SchoolCal will continue processing them until they're complete. Each sync after that typically takes 10 minutes or less.

                Does SchoolCal have to do a full sync each time?
              </h3>
              <p className="body-large text-text-dark-blue">
                No, it only looks for new updates or changes to your events.
              </p>
            </div>

                How does event color coding work?
              </h3>
              <p className="body-large text-text-dark-blue">
                The event colors are inherited by the user's Google calendar settings.
